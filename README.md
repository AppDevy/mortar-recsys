# Mortar Recommendation Engine

To allow you to get started quickly we have created this base recommendation engine project that you can fork to create your own project.  This project contains a couple of complete, runnable examples of the Mortar recommendation engine as well as a template project for easily getting started with your own data. The base Mortar project is open source and hosted in Github at https://github.com/mortardata/mortar-recsys.

For help running the examples or for getting started building your own recommendation engine see our tutorials at: help.mortardata.com/recommenders.
